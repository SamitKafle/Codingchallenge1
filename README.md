# Codingchallenge1
This is a part of class assignment for coding challenge in class for the course PLPA
This repository includes the R code for the fololwing steps
o	Creating a vector named 'z' with the values 1 to 200
o	Printing the mean and standard deviation of z on the console
o	Creating a logical vector named zlog that is 'TRUE' for z values greater than 30 and 'FALSE' otherwise.
o	Making a dataframe with z and zlog as columns. Name the dataframe zdf
o	Changing the column names in your new dataframe to equal “zvec” and “zlogic”
o	Making a new column in your dataframe equal to zvec squared (i.e., z2). Call the new column zsquared. 
o	Creating a Subset the dataframe with and without the subset() function to only include values of zsquared greater than 10 and less than 100 
o	Creating a Subset the zdf dataframe to only include the values on row 26
o	Creating aSubset the zdf dataframe to only include the values in the column zsquared in the 180th row.
